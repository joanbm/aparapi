This is a strongly modified fork from https://github.com/aparapi/aparapi. It was built to utilize devices that are connected to the host through dOpenCL. If you want to know more about dOpenCL head over to https://github.com/osmhpi/dopencl and further explanation will be given there. Please note that this fork of Aparapi has many changes installed that are specifically targeted at dOpenCL and may therefore cause problems when used in another context. Also using any other version of dOpenCL than the provided fork at https://github.com/osmhpi/dopencl will probably not yield successful results.
